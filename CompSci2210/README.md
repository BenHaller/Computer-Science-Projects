# Computer Science 2210 - Data Structures and Algorithms

Through this course, I learned the foundations of the basic data structures (dictionaries, hash tables, various search trees, graphs, etc.) and advanced my ability to create functional algorithms.

The portion of assignments that I created in this course do not necessarily provide functionality on their own, as they call upon classes created by my professor. However, this course involved the implementation of multiple different data structures as well as specific function-serving algorithms.

This course involved programming in Java, through which I learned how to naviage the Eclipse IDE.

## Assignments

Assignment 1 - involved the implementation of a dictionary as well as a hash table in order to store and retrieve a large number of entries in an efficient manner. This assignment also had me create an algorithm to analyze a game-board and check for any possible 'wins'.

Assignment 2 - implemented a binary search tree and all correlating operations upon it. Through this assignment I also implemented an algorithm to check for 'collisions' between objects on a UI screen.

Assignment 3 - created both node and edge java classes in order to create an undirected graph. This assignment also involved creating an algorithm to determine if a viable path existed through a 'maze' of roads.
