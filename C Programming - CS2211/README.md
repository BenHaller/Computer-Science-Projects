# Computer Science 2211- Software Tools and System Programming
This course explored the fundamentals of software programming and basic operating systems.
This course offered an introduction to programming within C, and of the fundamentals and tools provided by UNIX.
In taking this course, I learned both how to program within the C language and how to use UNIX to better traverse and work with the computer directly.
## Assignments
Assignment 1 - involved two C programs: one to convert between metric and imperial SI units, and the other to convert a given integer from 1-999 to its English-language equivalent (ex. 237 => two hundred and thirty-seven)

Assignment 2 - created a program to manipulate user-provided integers, placing them in an array and sorting the array based on multiple criteria

Assignment 3 - a non-scalable database was created to store World Cup teams and their information within C. This database allows the user to insert new teams, update existing teams, and view a specific team or the entire teams database

Assignment 4 - an extension of assignment 3, now with a scalable database. This assigment involved implementing a linked list in C that allocates and deallocates storage for teams during runtime as necessary

Assignment 5 - an introduction to UNIX shell scripting; involved creating bash scripts to encrypt and decrypt text files using a Caecar cipher
